  "notes": "Conservative estimates based on meta-analyses of prospective studies. Light consumption benefits are controversial and may not apply to all populations. Heavy drinking (>3L pure alcohol/year) significantly reduces life expectancy. Effects vary by individual factors including genetics, age, sex, and overall health status.
