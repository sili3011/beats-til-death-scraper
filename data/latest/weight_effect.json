  "notes": "Conservative estimates based on large-scale meta-analyses and prospective cohort studies. Effects represent average population-level associations and may vary significantly based on individual factors including age, sex, genetics, body composition, fitness level, and comorbidities. The relationship between BMI and mortality follows a J-shaped curve, with both underweight and obesity associated with increased mortality. For educational purposes only."
